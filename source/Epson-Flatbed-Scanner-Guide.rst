Epson 10000XL (Flatbed) 
=======================

******************
General Procedure:
******************

Items should be placed facing down with the top of the item toward the front of the scanner if possible. To access the scanning software click on the “EPSON Scan” thumbnail on the Desktop.

Once the EPSON Scan module appears, there are a number of adjustments that must be made before scanning.

![Image 5](https://github.com/lsulibraries/repository/blob/master/wikiimages/Image%2005.jpg)

In the upper right hand of the EPSON Scan module there is a “mode” option. This should always be “Professional Mode.” Below that is “Settings” under which the name should always read “Current Setting.” 

The next set of options is found under “Original,” including the “Document Type.” If the item to be scanned is not negative or positive film, the document type will be “Reflective” which comes with “Document Table” as the automatic “Document Source” and the choice of either “Photo” or “Document” for “Auto Exposure Type.” Always use the “Photo” setting when scanning anything that is not film. If the document to be scanned is film, the document type will be “Film” and the “Film Type” can be “Positive Film,” “Color Negative Film,” or “B&W Negative Film.” 

The “Destination” options will be largely determined by the type of item and user request. “Image Type” can range from “48-bit Color” to “8-bit Grayscale” to “Black & White.” Most of the time it will be set to “24-bit Color,” though black and white film and prints may be scanned with either 16- or 8-bit Grayscale. Typically items should be scanned at 600ppi or the resolution requested, whichever is higher. Ignore “Document Size.” Change “Target Size” only if the patron requests a larger image than the original item size. In this case, always scan the item at a slightly larger size than requested so that there is room for rotating and cropping. For example, if a patron requests that a 4x5 photograph be scanned to the 8x10 size, change the width to 8.5 and the height to 11 inches. Another option is to change the “Scale” to 205%. Make sure all “Adjustments” are unchecked unless instructed otherwise. 

Click on the thumbnail at the bottom right of the module with the image of a file and a portrait.

A module titled “File Save Settings” will appear. Under “Location” select “Other” then “Browse.” Depending on the project and user, the file location will vary, but one common file path is “R:\Digital Services\IMAGES\ - Collections\Manuscripts\New Folder.” Change the “File Name” “Prefix” to the appropriate name (ex. “4645B07”) and change the “Start Number” back to 001. For further instruction read “File Naming and Folder Structure” in the wiki. The “Image Format” should be TIFF, regardless of user request. Click “OK” to close the window and return to the EPSON Scan module.

Now click “Preview” to preview the item being scanned. Adjust the borders of the box so that they surround the area to be scanned and leave a white border around the item. Finally click "Scan." When the area is scanned it will automatically be saved to the folder you selected earlier. Go to the file and double click on the image you just scanned. “Adobe Photoshop CS6 (64bit)” should open automatically. The image in Photoshop can then be rotated and cropped, but no other adjustments should be made. The resulting file should then be resaved to the appropriate collection folder on the R Drive as a TIFF with no compression. 

To rotate an item in Photoshop go to the Image menu, Image Rotation. If the image is turned upside down, select “180°.” If the image is sideways, select either “90° CW” to turn it clockwise or “90° CCW” to turn it counterclockwise. If the image only needs to be adjusted slightly, select “Arbitrary…” Often an adjustment of .1° or .5° is all that is required to straighten an image.

To crop an item in Photoshop select the crop icon on the left of the screen. 

![Image 6] (https://github.com/lsulibraries/repository/blob/master/wikiimages/Image%2006.jpg)

Drag the edges of the box until only the image that you want and a small border around the image is visible. Click on the checkmark near the top right of the screen.

Frequently, the patron will request a different type of file, image, or a resolution lower than 600. To change the resolution find “Image Size” under “Image.” Under “Document Size” change the “Resolution to the requested ppi. 

![Image 3](https://github.com/lsulibraries/repository/blob/master/wikiimages/Image%2003.jpg)

Should the patron request a grayscale image, go to “Image” “Mode” and “Grayscale.”  A window will pop up and ask “Discard color information?” Select “Discard.” If the patron requests a file type other than a .tiff, this change can be made by going to “Save As” under “File” and changing the “Format.”

![Image 4](https://github.com/lsulibraries/repository/blob/master/wikiimages/Image%2004.jpg)

The resulting file should be saved to the appropriate patron scans folder on the R Drive. If the patron requests a full color, 600ppi (or higher) TIFF then the original file can also be saved or copied to the appropriate patron scans folder on the R Drive.

At times, a request will specify that the item should be scanned at a percentage of its size or with an output of a certain width or height. If the images are being made smaller, these changes can also be made in Photoshop by clicking on “Image” then “Image Size.” If they are being made larger, suggested procedure would be to make the changes during the scanning process. If a particular width and height is requested, change the number of pixels. If a particular percentage of its size is requested, change “Pixels” to “Percent” and then change the number in the box to the left. Never scan an item at less than 100%!
