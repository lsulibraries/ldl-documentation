Intro for Student Workers
=========================

##Why is student work so important to digital services?
Digital projects at LSU could not exist without the hard work of our student workers. Student workers primarily participate in the digital project process by digitizing the materials and creating some basic metadata for items during the digitization process. Without student work, the number of collections we could digitize each year would be dependent on grant money and would necessarily shrink to 1-2 each year.

##Rules and regulations:
We work with extremely rare and valuable materials, so it is important that we always handle them with the utmost care. Below are some good guidelines to follow.
When in doubt, always err on the side of caution. It's more important to protect the item than digitize it. If you have any questions about an item you are handling, please ask your supervisor for help.

###Protecting materials
* Always keep your hands clean. Please be sure to wash your hands at the beginning of each shift. As you work, your hands may get dirty if you are handling dirty materials. Please wash your hands often to avoid contaminating other materials. 
* Use gloves when handling photographs, so as not to leave fingerprints.
* Do not use gloves for other kinds of materials, as they tend to make our grip more clumsy, so we'll be more likely to damage things.

###Handling materials
* One trick for turning fragile pages of a bound item is to slide a piece of copy paper under it, then lift.
* Be careful! Use two hands to lift materials on and off of the scanner.

###Scanning materials
* All items should be scanned in the order in which they are placed in a folder or box, and files named accordingly.
* Only remove one folder from a box at a time.
* Utmost care should be taken that every page of every folder of every box remains in the order that it was originally placed in. If it appears that items are out of order, please notify your supervisor, but do not make any changes yourself.
* Verify that all non-acid-free paper (tracking slips, place markers, etc.) is never left next to materials. 

##How do I use the equipment?

###Scanning Practices 
When a scan request comes in each item must be evaluated to determine which scanner should be used for digitization. Factors for deciding this include the size of the item, the requested resolution and the fragility of the item.

If the item is 12&quot; by 17&quot; or less and can be placed face down without undue harm then it should be scanned on the flatbed scanner. Film or negatives of any type will also be scanned on the flatbed. Use of the flatbed gives us more control over the resolution at which the item is scanned, the output size of the files and lighting.

If the item is too large to fit the flatbed or it is a book that would be harmed by placing it face down on the scanner, then it should be digitized on the Zeutschel.

####Using the Epson Expression 100000XL or 11000XL (Flatbed)
Items should be placed facing down with the top of the item toward the front of the scanner if possible. To access the scanning software click on the “EPSON Scan” thumbnail on the Desktop. Choose your mode and settings, including document type, document source, film type, destination, resolution, and image type. For more detailed information, see the [Epson Flatbed Scanner Guide](https://github.com/lsulibraries/repository/wiki/Epson-Flatbed-Scanner-Guide).

####Zeutschel OS 12000 A1
Items too large or too fragile for the flatbed scanner may be scanned with the Zeutschel scanner. The Zeutschel OS 12000 A1 has a scan area of 33.3" x 23.6", allowing for easy scanning of oversized items at a resolution of up to 600 pixels per inch. The book cradle and glass plate make this scanner the perfect choice for scanning rare or fragile books. You will generally be selecting a pre-existing setting on the scanner. For more information, please refer to the [Zeutschel OS 12000 Advanced Scanning Procedures](https://github.com/lsulibraries/repository/wiki/Zeutschel-OS-12000-Advanced-Scanning-Procedures)

###File-naming Practices
####File Folder Structure
Images should always be saved in one of three locations, the Collection Folder, Projects Folder, or the Patron Request folder.

<u>Digitization Projects of LSU Libraries Materials</u>

Projects where an entire box or collection are being digitized will be saved to the Collection folder, as this is where we store our highest resolution, full color TIFFs. The collection folders can be found at: R:\Digital Services\IMAGES\- Collections

There are then subfolders for the following collections: LLMVC, Manuscripts,
McIlhenny, Rare Books and University Archives.

For items that belong to the LLMVC, McIlhenny or Rare Books collections, new
folders should be created under the appropriate heading for each book scanned.
The folder name should contain the Call Number and title.

For example, the folder for the Elk's Souvenir at Call No. F 379 B33E44 c2 would be:
R:\Digital Services\IMAGES\- Collections\LLMVC\F 379 B33E44 c2 - Elks Souvenir

The folder for The Dapuri drawings by Henry J. Noltie at Call No. QK98.2.N64 2002 OVER would be:
R:\Digital Services\IMAGES\- Collections\McIlhenny\QK98 2 N64 2002 OVER - the Dapuri Drawings

Manuscript item folders should be named slightly differently, with the Mss. Number, and the title of the collection.

For Example, the folder for the Turnbull (Dudley and Family) Papers, Mss. No.
2907 would be: R:\Digital Services\IMAGES\- Collections\Manuscripts\2907 - Turnbull (Dudley and Family) Papers

Folders for University Archives should be named with the records group and the records group name

For Example, the folder for the Office of the President is: R:\DigitalServices\IMAGES\- Collections\University Archives\A0001 - Office of the President Records

After saving an image to the proper collection folder, that
image (or its derivative) should be saved in the Patron Requests folder</p>

<u>Digitization Projects of non-LSU Libraries Materials</u>

A folder will be named based on the institution contributing the materials and metadata. Within this folder, naming of the items should follow the same conventions whenever possible. For example, there will often not be a manuscript or call number, in which case we should use another unique identifier such as a title.

<u>Patron Requests</u>

If a patron requests a 600ppi (or higher), full color TIFF of an item that has already been digitized, the the image can be copied over to the folder for that patron's order. If they request a lower resolution, grayscale or a JPG, then that modified file should be saved to their patron requests folder. 
<b>Be careful when creating derivative files not to save over the original!</b>

The vast majority of patron requests come from Special Collections. The Special Collections patron request folders can be found at: R:\SpecialCollections\Patron Requests

Folders for each transaction should be created in the folder corresponding with the year the request was submitted, and named with the transaction number, such as: R:\SpecialCollections\Patron Requests\2016\5122
