===========================
Digital Projects Lifecycle
===========================

*****************************************************************
Audience:
*****************************************************************

All potential collaborators with LSU Libraries Digital Services.

*****************************************************************
Purpose: 
*****************************************************************

To ensure digital project planning and workflow are documented and understood.

*****************************************************************
Project Pre-Assessment
*****************************************************************

  1. Collaborating institutions or departments will submit a [Digital Services project proposal] (http://www.lib.lsu.edu/services/digital/policies).

    * Collaborator(s) will determine projects or collections according to their own collection development policy (CDP) and preservation and access priorities.
    * If the Collaborator does not have a collection development policy the project can be assessed with the LSU Libraries CDP and LSU Digital Collections Best Practices (link forthcoming).

  2. Digital Services will meet with the Collaborator(s) in person to assess the physical state of the collection and to identify potential obstacles with digitization and access as outlined in the Digital Collections Digitization Questionnaire (S:\Departments\Digital Services\External\Documentation).

    * Completing the Questionnaire is a joint effort between Digital Services staff and the Collaborator(s) and the project will not start until both parties have reviewed the document.
    * For advisement about whether a project is a good candidate for digitization, consult the questions found in the LSU Digital Collections Best Practices.
    * Digital Services will provide Collaborator(s) with an estimated completion time for the digital project and will regularly update all parties on progress. Project progress is tracked internally using Producteev software.
       
*****************************************************************
Metadata Pre-assessment
*****************************************************************

 3. Collaborator(s) should provide basic metadata or descriptions for materials to be digitized.

    * Any metadata or descriptions to be associated with particular items in the collection must be provided in an order easily matched to the materials. This can take the form of a container list that matches the physical arrangement of the collection or item-level descriptions in a Word document or Excel spreadsheet if each item is labeled.
    * The structure of the digital collection will match the physical arrangement of the items or the order in which they are received unless another arrangement is agreed upon before digitization begins. Collections may be arranged and described at different levels (e.g., item, folder, box, album), depending on the need for description.

 4. Digital Services staff and Collaborator(s) will work with metadata and cataloging librarians and/or subject specialists to develop a data dictionary and/or controlled vocabulary specific to the project before digitization begins.

    * When possible the general data dictionary developed for similar projects (i.e., digitized manuscript collections) will be used.
    * The digital collection fields will be determined based on the data dictionary.

*****************************************************************
Transfer of the Materials
*****************************************************************

 5. The contributing institution will be responsible for delivering materials to Digital Services according to mutual requirements and schedules.

    * Digital Services will digitize the materials, name the files, and embed metadata in the files.
    * Digitized materials will be archived on the R: drive in a hierarchical file structure based on the physical arrangement of the materials (i.e., root folder will contain the manuscript number or record group number). Digital arrangement of files will reflect the order in which the physical materials are arranged (e.g., box = digital folder, folder = digital folder).
 6. Once the digitization is complete (i.e. the scanning and general description of the materials) the contributors may retrieve the materials at their convenience.

    * Per existing policies, materials will be stored in a locked cabinet in a secured office during the time that they are not being digitized.
    * Retrieval of materials before a project is completed is possible, but may result in multiple transfers of materials and delays in project completion.

*****************************************************************
Creating the Digital Collection
*****************************************************************
 7. In preparation for adding materials to the Louisiana Digital Library, general metadata is extracted from the embedded file metadata into an Excel spreadsheet. The metadata embedded in the files will be based on descriptions received before digitization begins.

    * As determined in the initial assessment, more metadata may be added by catalogers or subject specialists. Digital projects that include collaborative cataloging or metadata creation are added to the LDL with minimal metadata and then cataloged by non-DS staff in the CONTENTdm Project Client. However, Digital Services will work with metadata providers to tailor the project workflow to their needs (i.e., creating metadata in Excel rather than the Project Client).
    * Collaborator(s) will be involved in metadata development and will be responsible for checking fields and reviewing the entire collection before it is published.

 8. Collaborators will provide information about the collection that will be used to add the collection to the LDL.

    * Collaborators will work with DS to create a collection description document and homepage/landing page description. DS will add the collection to the LDL “collection of collections.” An example is S:\Departments\Digital Services\External\Documentation\Example_ldl_coll_descrip_lytle_p15140coll12. docx.
    * Digital Services will work with Collaborator(s) to identify images for the collection banner, collection thumbnail, and/or additional homepage images. Collaborators are free to create their own images using the parameters below or Digital Services staff can create the images.

     * Homepage banner image: jpg file; 800x225 pixels
     * LDL thumbnails: jpg file; 70x70 pixels
     * Libraries website thumbnails: jpg file; 120x120 pixels

*****************************************************************
Beyond Collection Creation
*****************************************************************

 9. As the LDL and LSU Digital Services evolve, future changes to existing digital collections may be necessary. Digital Services staff will work with Collaborators to minimize the amount of work required post digital collection creation and completion.

    * LDL participation in the Digital Public Library of America or LDL platform changes may require adjustments to field names and metadata. Collaborators can review these changes and DS will assist in adjusting metadata to the needs of any new systems or collaborators.


 10. Digital preservation of archival (master) and access (derivative) digital files will be discussed with contributors during project planning.

    * All master and derivative files created for contributors within the LSU Libraries will be saved on Libraries servers and routinely backed up.
    * Derivative files will be created for the Collaborator(s) and for LDL upload as necessary.
    * Digital preservation of other non-LSU Contributors’ projects will be discussed on a project by project basis and may involve additional fees. Digital Services will work with a collaborator to create a digital preservation plan.
