This wiki is the authoritative source for information about the Louisiana Digital Library (LDL) produced by Louisiana State University's LSU Libraries. It will be continually updated with information about the history of the LDL, publications about new and existing collections in the LDL, and details about the development of the new Louisiana Digital Library Islandora platform. LSU Digital Services has created a variety of documentation describing procedures, policies, and past practices of the department. This documentation is constantly evolving as the tools available and the projects assigned grow and change. It currently includes:
 * Information about the equipment available in our digital lab
 * How-to guides for students and GAs
 * Metadata guidelines for catalogers and other contributors
 * Forms to be filled about by those interested in beginning a new project

Our long-term goal is a website that describes the process of digitization from idea to long-term maintenance, including adaptations to new best practices, tools, and software platforms. 

A website that provides similar information about a multi-site Islandora infrastructure and related digital project process is [FL-Islandora Guides](https://fig.wiki.flvc.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page). This site is an excellent place to look for a "wiki providing detailed user documentation and how-tos to university & college librarians and library staff."

Another similar site that provides an example of documentation for an individual institution's metadata and digital services documentation is [UA Libraries Metadata & Digital Services] (http://www.lib.ua.edu/wiki/digcoll/index.php/Main_Page).
