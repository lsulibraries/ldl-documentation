Steps thus far (5/21/2015)
--------------------------

On 5/21/2015 at 10:30 am, rtilla requested an OHMS instance for LSU Libraries titled LSU Libraries. As of 5/21/2015, no confirmation of this had been recieved.

Also on 5/21/2015 at 12:00 pm, rtilla added images of two error messages to the repository git. The "internet archive book module" does appear to allow uploading of PDF files (it may even be required). It also allows you to OCR the document as part of the upload, use the embedded text, or not do any text transcription at all. However, due to the error, I cannot prove this. Both times it appeared to work and then quit halfway through.

Broken Book Module-1.jpg shows what happened the first time I uploaded (I asked it to create an 8-bit greyscale PDF and extract the text OCR). Broken Book Module-2.jpg shows what happened the second time I uploaded (I asked it to create the default image and extract the text OCR).
