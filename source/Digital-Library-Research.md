## Introduction

Research about statewide and regional digital libraries similar to the Louisiana Digital Library commenced in Fall 2013 at LSU, as Deans and directors from several institutions considered options besides LOUIS serving as the administrator. Ultimately the institutions decided to work independently of LOUIS and form a separate consortium, the Louisiana Digital Consortium. As of June 30, 2014, the LDL has been independent.

## Research to Inform a New Direction

Tasked with looking at other statewide and regional digital libraries, Rachel Tillay identified a list of 100 listed on the website [State Digital Resources: Memory Projects, Online Encyclopedias, Historical & Cultural Materials Collections](http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/statememory/) compiled by Christine A. Pruzin and posted by the Library of Congress. Determining aspects like organizational size and leadership, funding sources, staffing and governance, and software/hardware proved to be more difficult than anticipated. Documentation is scarce on the actual digital library sites and published materials about digital libraries tend to focus on highlighting specific project-based digital collections. 

### Organizational Structure and Leadership 

The largest impact on the structure is the number of participants. Approximately twenty sites are run by one institution, usually a department of the state, a state library or archives, or a partnership of both of these organizations. Another twenty-two sites which contain between two and nine institutions, are partnerships between multiple state agencies and/or a public university. Approximately thirty-nine sites have more than ten contributors with about nine of which having over one hundred participants. The LDL with twenty-two contributors is of a comparable size to the majority of sites that contain multiple institutions. 

Besides the forty-two sites that do not provide explicit information, the largest group includes those that are open to a variety of cultural institutions with collections related to or residing in a particular state, region, or topic. Many of these sites specify that the potential member must be an organization, not an individual, and they must be interested in making their digital holding available online. Around thirteen of the sites included in this survey are encyclopedia-style sites that allow individuals or organizations to submit secondary source content such as articles or encyclopedia entries. These individuals may be associated with an institution that has already contributed, sometime they can contribute an entire exhibit, and occasionally they can include links to finding aids and images of a variety of repositories. 

Assuming that the LDL’s goal is to grow and increase the number of collaborators, there are many ideas for increasing the number of participants found in the work of those sites listed on the Excel spreadsheet. Many of the libraries include materials from public libraries from around the state, which is an idea that is already being explored. The LDL might consider following the lead of Recollection Wisconsin which includes materials and representatives from Wisconsin Public Radio on the advisory committee.
